# Catppuccin-Dwm
a dwm rice but its catppuccin!
# This rice works best with the following configurations
a picom config with shadows, put the config file in autostart.sh where the "picom -b --experimental-backends --config <pathtoyourconfig>" is there
use the jonaburg picom
use nitrogen for the wallpaper
and arco linux is recommended
thanks.
